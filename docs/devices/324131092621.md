## Notes


### Pairing
Factory reset the Hue dimmer switch by pressing and holding the setup button on the back for 10 seconds.

Restart the Hue dimmer switch by holding all 4 buttons of the Hue dimmer switch.
You can let go when the light on the front flashes red/green briefly.

Use the Hue dimmer switch to factory reset a Hue light bulb see
[HOWTO: Factory reset a Hue bulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlEAELiJKs).
After resetting the bulb will automatically connect.
This method also works for Philips Hue Lightstrips.
Hue dimmer switch can also be used to factory reset Ikea Tr√•dfri light bulbs using the same method described above.

### Binding
If you want to bind the dimmer to a (Hue) lamp you'll have to *[bind it to the lamp through MQTT](../information/binding.html)* and unbind it from the coordinator. Use the dimmer as source and a literal `coordinator` as target for that.

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `multiple_press_timeout`: Controls how long (in seconds) subsequent key presses may be apart and still count as one event. The default is 250ms (0.25).

## OTA updates
